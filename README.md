# Pong Game

A simple fun game involving two paddles and walls on which the ball bounces. 
To be played in the console, implemented using C.

### Controls
This a two player game, the first player must use the 'w' and 's' keys in the keyboard, whereas the second player must press the 'i' and 'k' keys, to move the paddles up and down respectively.

### Compiler
I have used the conio.h header file which is not a part of ANSI C standard. Make sure to use a compiler which supports conio.h.
kbhit() and getch() are the functions used which are defined in conio.h.
